# User Management System - IS601 Final Project

## Introduction
Developed under the guidance of Professor William Keith, the User Management System showcases the capabilities of modern web technologies as a part of the IS601 course. This open-source project utilizes the 12-Factor App methodology and Agile Manifesto principles to provide a hands-on learning experience in software development, preparing students to build scalable, maintainable, and production-ready applications.

### Key Methodologies
- **12-Factor App Methodology**: Teaches important software engineering concepts such as codebase management, dependency control, and environmental consistency.
- **Agile Practices**: Encourages an environment of teamwork, iterative development, and continuous customer collaboration.
- **Industry Standards**: Focuses on coding standards like PEP 8 and introduces critical practices such as error handling and dependency injection.

## Features and Issues Addressed
- **Profile Picture Upload with Minio**: Enhances user profile management by allowing users to securely upload and store profile pictures using Minio. [More about this feature](https://github.com/NidhishVyas/user_management/pull/6)
- **Issues solved**:
  - Code Update: Automatic Verification Email on User Registration [Issue Link](https://github.com/rk94407/final_project/tree/1-send-verification-email)
  - Update to User Response Model: Status Code 400 for Duplicate Nickname Registration [Issue Link](https://github.com/NidhishVyas/user_management/pull/2)
  - Ensuring Non-Negative Skip and Positive Limit Parameters [Issue Link](https://github.com/NidhishVyas/user_management/pull/3)
  - Implementation of Password Validation [Issue Link](https://github.com/NidhishVyas/user_management/pull/4)
  - Enhanced URL Validation with Updated Regex Pattern [Issue Link](https://github.com/NidhishVyas/user_management/pull/5)

## Test Cases
Included test cases cover a variety of functionality and validation scenarios:
- `test_email_verification_test`
- `test_create_user_duplicate_nickname`
- `test_user_base_nickname_valid`
- and more...
