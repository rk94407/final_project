## 8. ðŸŽ« QR Code Generation User Invites with Minio

- **Description:** Implement QR code generation functionality for user profiles, allowing users to share their profile information easily. Store the generated QR codes using Minio.
- **User Story:** As a user, I want to be able to invite people to the site through email by inputing their name and email address..
- **Difficulty Level:** Medium
- **Minimum Viable Feature:**
  - Implement user invitation functionality through the API, allowing users to invite others to join the platform via email with a QR code in the invitation email.
  - Generate unique QR codes for each invite that encodes parameter for a base64 encoded nickname field (nickname exists in the db) that identifies the user that invited them, so that we can track sucessful invitations.  Create a table to track invitations and their usage.  When you scan the QR code, the user should just be forwarded to another address set with a setting in config.py and their QR invite should be marked accepted in the database.
  - Store the generated QR codes securely in Minio.  [Setting up Object Storage with Minio with Docker](https://kodekloud.com/community/t/setting-up-object-storage-with-minio-with-docker/336624)
  - Provide an API endpoint for QR codes to show a user the number of invites sent and used.
  - Provide an API endpoint to accept the invite
  - Use .env file for forward email
  - Provide a management BREAD HATEOS complete set of endpoints to administer invitations
- **Optional Enhancements:**
  - 
  - Provide options to share the QR code image on social media or via email.
- **Getting Started:**
  - Set up Minio for storing the generated QR code images.
  - Research and select a suitable QR code generation library for your programming language.
  - Design the QR code generation process, including the data to be encoded in the QR code (e.g., user profile URL).
  - Implement the QR code generation functionality, storing the generated images in Minio.
  - Write unit tests to verify the QR code generation, storage, and retrieval functionality.
  - Write tests for testing the usage of the QR code to accept the invite by simulating the incoming request and updating the QR code
  - WRite any additional tests to verify the BREAD HATEOS functionality similar to the Users table, but simpler.
